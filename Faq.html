                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Electromagnetic Therapy has undergone over 2000 scientific and clinical double blind placebo trials worldwide. Benefits of Pulsed Electro-Magnetic Field (“PEMF”) therapy have been published in more than 10000 scientific papers. Millions of treatments have already been successfully done with PEMF systems in more than 80 countries worldwide and proved to be very effective in a wide range of conditions including Pain, Bone healing, Arthritis, Depression.</p>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">Q 2. Any special instructions for the wellness session? <span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>There are two important instructions:</p>

                                    <p>1) Sit on a plastic or wooden chair that will insulate you from the floor. Dry plastic or wooden Plastic chair is most recommended for better insulation. Don’t use cane (bamboo or rattan) or metal chairs as it could be poor insulators and could produce electrostatic leakage resulting to less effectiveness of the session.</p>

                                    <p>2) Remember to drink lots of water throughout the day, especially before and after your wellness session to help with the detox flushing.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">Q 3. Do I need to undress for the Session?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>No All sessions are administered with you being fully dressed.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">Q 4. Can a session be administered while the patient has a plaster cast or Metal implants,?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>PEMF waves have the capacity of reaching into the body and healing an imbalance without touching anything. No other form of therapy achieves deep tissue treatment. It can be used even over Plaster cast since magnetic fields permeate all materials. It can also be used with plates & fixators because no damaging heat is produced in the implants.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">Q 5. Why do I get so tired after I use the Device?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>As mentioned before, the device enhances our blood circulation like a good work out, and so, improves the oxygenation in our body. Sleep is also enabling the better oxygen supply and utilization in our body, like the Chinese medicine says: "Sleep cleans and enriches the blood". There is a reason for us to need the sleep, and without the proper oxygenation, our body cannot build and maintain good health and a functioning immune system.</p>

                                    <p>By using the wellness device, the body experiences an improved circulation, and so, the oxygen absorption is significantly improved. This creates that very relaxed sensation. Yet, if we are over stressed in our daily life, or, in lots of pain, the enhanced blood circulation, as it naturally supposed to, not only supplies more oxygen to all our body parts and functions, but also transfers the many toxic derbies out of the body. This is what we refer to when we mention the "stimulation of the self healing mechanism". We call it a very natural and very healthy process. Healing - takes a lot of energy and makes us tired at first.</p>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 6. Why “feet” position is considered as the main position?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>It is based on the principles of foot reflexology. The human feet and sole contain approx 7200 nerve endings. These nerve endings or the reflex points have interconnections through the spinal cord and brain with all areas of the body. Stimulation of these reflex points on the bottom of the feet can help in maintaining the health of the body organs and promote healing.</p>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 7. Why would our bones benefit?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Small children grow healthy bones through their jumping around, playing jumping games, run around a lot, climbing and enjoy the outdoors activity. In our day and age, we adults do the very same only on vacation, once or in the good case twice a year.</p>

                                    <p>Like the Astronauts lose their bone density and need to take extra measures to replenish their bones, so do we, adults. Due to lack of resistance, high sugar nutrition, too much salt in our food, pop soda of all kinds, and no bouncing motion on daily basis, we lose our bone density and tend to fractions.</p>

                                    <p>The wellness device creates the closest imitation of the bouncing element so vital for our bones, as well as the blood circulation stimulus. This is a very supporting combination for healthier bones, hair and nails.</p>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 8. What causes pain in joints?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>There are our cushions of cartilage between our bones, which prevents bone grinding. When these layers wear out, the bones begin to grind against each other. This causes extreme pain. Normally, the body naturally replaces cartilage using tiny electrical signals. These signals are created within our body. Disease prevents the normal replacement of cartilage - e.g. osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, aging or injury and consequently there will be pain & inflammation.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 9. How does PEMF reduce pain in joints?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Electrical changes can occur within and around the cell as a direct result of the pulsing electromagnetic field.  This produces improved blood supply and an increase in oxygen pressure, which in turn activates and regenerates cells; calcium transport is improved, which stimulates repair and growth of cartilage. This will subsequently decrease pain.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 10. How does PEMF relief back pain?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>PEMF has proven to be very effective for osteoporosis treatment. Due to improved blood supply oxygen levels increase, activating and regenerating cells. This results in improved calcium transport and better absorption of calcium in the bones and simultaneously decreases pain dramatically.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 11. Why do osteoporosis patients often have back pain?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Due to 'brittle' bones osteoporosis patients often suffer from very painful micro-fractures in the vertebrae of the spine. After a few weeks of wellness sessions pain relief is obtained, by closing of these micro-fractures. In addition to the increase of bone density, results in improved fracture healing and less risk of breaking bones.</p>
                                </div>

                                <h3 class="entry-title d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"> Q 12. Will it assist to improve the bone density?<span class="arrow-r"></span></h3>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Results from the University of Graz in Austria show an increase in bone density of approximately 6% after only one year. According to the Pacific Health Research Institute in Honolulu bone density rose in post-menopausal females by an average of 5.6%. Improved bone density helps to maintain good health and a decreased risk in spontaneous fractures. Poor bone density = increased fracture risk. Good bone density = decreased fracture risk. Once bone density a carefully structured and monitored fitness programme will increase the rate of bone density increase.</p>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Your heart pushes your blood through a network of blood vessels called arteries. As the blood travels through the arteries it pushes against the sides of these blood vessels and the strength of this pushing is called your blood pressure. The narrowing of the blood vessels forces the heart to pump harder, and blood pressure rises creating condition of hypertension or High blood pressure.</p>

                                    <p>Pulsating magnet potentials help loaded particles in the bloodstream to oscillate in the rhythm of the device frequency. These high frequency vibrations can reduce friction & flow resistance in narrow capillaries and improves blood circulation.</p>

                                    <p>Further the FIR heat helps to regain blood vessels elasticity, and the vasodilation effect expands the capillaries and dilates the blood to assist the control of hypertension.</p>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>Your blood pH level is 7.4, which is slightly alkaline based. If you take in too much acidic food, your blood tends to become more acidic. To maintain pH level of 7.4, calcium in your bone will be extracted into blood stream since calcium is alkaline based. Eventually, you will have all sorts of body stiffness, body pain and even bone spur. A chronically over-acidic pH corrodes body tissue, slowly eating into the more than 60,000 miles of veins and arteries like acid eating into marble.</p>

                                    <p>Acidic body environment also prevents your immunity cells from functioning properly. This in turn leads to lowering of your immune system. You will also have poor blood circulation. In short, an acidic body causes most diseases.</p>

                                <div class="entry-content">
                                    <p>In general, metabolism refers to chemical reactions in body cells. As food is broken down or oxidized, energy is produced. Cell mitochondria give out heat and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a vital form of chemical energy utilized in all cell activity. Activity releases carbon dioxide, water, and other waste products. When cell membranes do not receive the required amount of energy, this sequence of reactions is impaired resulting cell disintegration.</p>

                                    <p>It is long been known that there is electricity in our bodies. Presence of electrocardiogram (ECG), & electroencephalogram (EEG) is due to these electrical impulses of the body cells. In 1956 the piezoelectric effect in bones was discovered by Fukada and Yasuda; a physicist and an orthopedic surgeon in Japan. The combined effects of electric and magnetic force explain that pulsing electromagnetic fields induce electrical changes on a cellular level within the body and cell metabolism is influenced.</p>

                                    <p>This can only be accomplished when the pulsing electromagnetic fields penetrate sufficiently deep within the human body. The electrical influence and increase of the membrane cell potential, causes an increase in oxygenation, which in turn increase the supply of nutrients.

                                    <p>If your condition got worsened after sessions, we are now VERY MUCH sure to have improvement in your health problem! We name this as <b>“Recovery symptoms”. </b>This is simple yet very important while taking the wellness sessions. Let’s understand a routine example…</p>

                                    <p>One fine day, you find an opportunity (such as a family picnic where your friends insist you to play football) and play it wholeheartedly. You really enjoy every kick towards the ‘goal’ and live every moment. All is fine unless you sleep and get up next morning. The body aches a lot and there is unbearable pain. For some people, it’s even difficult to get up from the bed. Similar things happen when you join the gym and do physical workout after years of practice. This thing heals itself if you continue.</p>

                                    <p>The improvement reaction is felt within a few days of regular sessions. They will go gradually and you don’t need to worry about them.
